See the README in ~/svx_admin/w7wrg_svxlink/build_scripts for how the install was done


*****************************************************************************************

Enable svxlink on boot with systemd
sudo systemctl enable svxlink

Start/stop 
sudo systemctl start/stop svxlink

*****************************************************************************************

Eventsource is a perl script that reads svxlink state information and distribute to 
clients on port 1535 (default).  It's not necessary for normal operation but can be
used by remote programs like a web site.
For test purposes you can simple telnet to port 1535, send a single return and wait for data

Enable it with:
sudo systemctl enable eventsource.service

Start/stop
sudo systemctl start/stop eventsource

*****************************************************************************************
		File locations

/etc/svxlink		Svxlink main config and other support files
/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf	snmpd.conf for remote graphing
/etc/fail2ban		Installed to watch for hack attempts on SSH and other services
			Edit /etc/fail2ban/jail.local and add to the ignoreip line any hosts
			you normally ssh from.  This prevents you from locking youself out.
/etc/logrotate.d/svxlink	Keep log files from growing to large.
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf	loopback and audio configuration
/etc/nftables.conf	Firewall rules
/etc/vim		updated VIM editor files - I don't like the stock config
/etc/cron.d/svxlink	Cron entries for svxlink specific functions if needed

/usr/share/svxlink/...	Svxlink events,sounds,tcl etc.

/usr/share/svxlink/events.d/local/...		Any x.tcl file found here with a namespace will add functions to that space
						You can even copy over a file from /usr/share/svxlink/events.d , rename it and
						change it's namespace and have it available from  the svxlink.conf file.
						Ex,  copy Simplex.tcl to local/RfLink.tcl and rename it's namespace to RfLink
						You now have a new logic that behaves like a Simplex logic but can be customized to
						behave differently.
Current customized files are:
/usr/share/svxlink/events.d/local/locale.tcl
/usr/share/svxlink/events.d/local/Logic_mods.tcl
/usr/share/svxlink/events.d/local/MetarInfo.tcl
/usr/share/svxlink/events.d/local/RepeaterLogic.tcl	

/usr/share/svxlink/sounds	Location of all sound files in an American female voice although an American male voice is available on request.
				There is a subdir called Custom that contains sounds not in the
				stock release.   All sounds are generated by python and bash scripts that use the Google Text to Speech
				system to create the .wav files.   To generate your own you need the appropriate Google application credentials
				The scripts are currently not ready for prime time (but close)	Ask N7IPB if you would like something custom.

/usr/local/bin		Shell and binary programs for svxlink, 1-wire probes, and other functions

/home/pi		The old stock login - the account is locked to prevent access

/home/svx_admin		The main management account.
/home/svx_admin/Projects	The location of all addon projects.  I don't clutter up the home directory.
/home/svx_admin/Projects/mail_ip Lets you mail the current ip addresss to a destination.  Needs customization
/home/svx_admin/Projects/rpi-1wire	Code to scan the 1-wire bus for ds18b20 temperature probes- See the README.md file
/home/svx_admin/Projects/rpi-sensors	Code to read the RPi CPU and GPU temps and print them out - used by snmpd if you set it up to create graphs on pnw220.net
/home/svx_admin/Projects/svxlink		The svxlink source
/home/svx_admin/Projects/w7wrg_svxlink		Image creation scripts and stock files.  The scripts will copy many of these directories over
						to their final destination.


***** Security *****
Since the RPi is generally sitting exposed on the Internet you need to take some precautions

1. The nft firewall is active and the /etc/nftables.conf file covers most of your needs.
2. The snmpd port is non-standard, write access is denied and the read-only community has been changed - Security thru obscurity but it's better than none.
3. The Pi user can not be logged into.
4. Fail2ban monitors ssh attempts and locks addressed that attempt to many out.

More can be done but the above does a lot.  
	One item that I would recommend is moving the ssh port to something non-standard.  Even changing it to the common 222 used by AllStarLink would help.
	Change it in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and make the coresponding change in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local (the port command)

SSH public keys
/home/svx_admin/.ssh/authorized_keys	My ssh public key is here.  Feel free to remove it to keep me out - N7IPB :-)
					I highly recommend you add public keys for anyone authorized to login and work on the system.
