Raspberry pi cpu and gpu temperature.

temp_gpu is a script and you need to be a member of the video group
to execute it. 

A pre-compiled version of temp_rpi is provided but if needed
can be compiled with:

gcc temp_rpi.c temp_rpi

Both can be copied to /usr/bin with:

sudo cp temp_rpi temp_gpu /usr/bin
